## I Exist and so Does My Blog

Hello World,

Over a decade has passed since my last attempt to write my thoughts on a public page – since that last Tumblr blog, any thoughts about starting to write again has died before the first letter could be written.

As many before me, I was defeated by the blank page many times in this period, but I recently started to look deeper into this fear of being read by other people – special thanks to my therapist who wouldn't quit bugging me about this issue.

What do you do with the things you want? Are you afraid people won't like your ideas? What gives, ol' droogie?

A combo of situations in my life (involving work and a great book) guided me to a hypothesis: to simply **exist** in this bleak world is a strenuous task – it is a constant battle to create while everyone else is destroying by habit.

It isn't really a question of how good or bad people are, I believe it is more of a generally negative feeling towards life and its challenges.

Our society's values have changed – the production we once admired has been replaced by empty fame. Why would I write anything for people who don't value the content of a book and instead only want to boast their "Reading Challenge" goals? Why would I publish anything to a public who values "Likes" instead of ideas?

I found the answer: I'll write because I can and I'll share ideas because I have many good ones. Whoever appreciates it will only be able to do it because I appreciate it myself.

In the words of Francisco D'Anconia: "I can't tell you how thoroughly I appreciate it".

I exist and so does my blog.
