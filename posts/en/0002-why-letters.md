# Why Letters?

Esteemed colleagues,

Recently I've been commenting that I enjoy writing stories and ideas in the format of letters.

I noticed I've been doing this without giving any thought to what I was saying!

Of course, as usual, I went needlessly deep into the idea after realising my lack of over-analysis, trying to figure out the reason why my delusional brain blurts apparent nonsense out of the blue! In this case I believe some sort of logic has been found.

The feeling behind having this writing space comes from the need of expressing ideas without attaching them to "the real world", keeping it such as the often sought "safe place". Coming from me you probably think that I mean it in a bad way, and it is usually nice to push yourself and make an effort to be bolder, smarter or anythinger – as long as you have a clear goal, otherwise you're just getting stressed for no reason! When writing I definitely get stressed for no reason.

For now, writing letters is allowing exploration of different perspectives, styles and general storytelling techniques! Exactly what my personal occasion requires.

Building on top of that feeling of freedom, these letters also give me an opportunity to try the hand at fiction! The structure of a regular fictional narrative had too many details that made me want to study the whole history of literature before finally spilling out my thoughts!

Letters allow for changes of heart and the chance to develop the idea gradually while keeping the level of honesty always in check.

I'm excited!

T.W.

PS. I get way too fancy with the words when I get excited, please forgive that.
